    <p>The Education page of my portfolio outlines the key stages of my academic and self-taught learning journey. I began my formal education by successfully completing both my primary and high school studies, which laid the foundation for my discipline, curiosity, and problem-solving mindset. These early years helped shape my interest in technology and set the stage for my future in software development.

Currently, I am pursuing a software engineering program at Zindua School, where I’m gaining hands-on experience in web development, programming, and building real-world applications. This structured learning environment has been instrumental in deepening my understanding of both front-end and back-end technologies.

In addition to formal education, I’ve also taken the initiative to teach myself front-end development through online platforms like W3Schools. This self-guided learning has helped me build a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and has allowed me to experiment with building responsive and interactive web pages on my own.

This page will continue to grow as I advance in my studies, earn new certifications, and expand my technical skill set through both formal and independent learning.</p><br><br>
