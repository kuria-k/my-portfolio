    <h1>Get to know Kev more here!!</h1>
    <p>Hello! My name is Kelvin Kuria, a 20-year-old software engineering student currently studying at Zindua School. I’m passionate about technology and driven by a desire to create meaningful digital experiences. As I dive deeper into the world of software development, I’m constantly learning how to build efficient, user-friendly applications that solve real-world problems. In addition to my tech journey, I’m also partially involved in business, where I enjoy exploring entrepreneurial ideas and understanding how innovation can drive growth. Outside of academics and coding, I’m an avid reader who loves getting lost in books, a movie enthusiast who appreciates a good story, and a swimmer who finds peace and energy in the water. My diverse interests fuel my creativity and keep me balanced, and I’m excited to keep growing both personally and professionally as I carve out my path in tech and beyond.</p>
